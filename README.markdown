# slack-say

This is a small library/script to control talking as Slackbot.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g slack-say
```

You'll need to create config.json (there's a sample included) in order to set your URL, Slackbot token, and default channel.

Then:

```bash
slackSay 'Hello, World!' '#general'
```
